# COVID Dashboard
#####      > ECM1400 Coursework Project

The aim of this coursework was to create a personalised data dashboard which would provide the user with up-to-data COVID statistics, along with relavant news stories.
This was implemented using various modules, including:
	> flask : Used to run the web application, implementing the interface using the *index.html* file provided
	> sched : Used to schedule updates to the interface (statistics and news) at times specified by the user
	> uk_covid19 and requests : Used to fetch data from the relavant APIs

Along with other backend modules:
	> json : Used to load API responses into a readable dictionary format
	> logging : Used to track the program during runtime
	> pytest : Used to run test (prior to execution)
